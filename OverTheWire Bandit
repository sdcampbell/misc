The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded dataIn order to improve my Linux skills I decided to tackle OverTheWire Bandit. There are 27 levels.

Level 0 to 1

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH to log into that level and continue the game.

To get the password you simply had to cat the readme file.

bandit0@melinda:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@melinda:~$ cat readme

Level 1 to 2

The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory.
Commands you may need to solve this level: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

There are different ways of accomplishing the same task in Bash:

bandit1@melinda:~$ cat `find . -name '-' -print`
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
bandit1@melinda:~$ find . -name '-' -exec cat {} +
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
bandit1@melinda:~$ find . -name '-' | xargs cat
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
bandit1@melinda:~$ cat $(find . -name '-')
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
bandit1@melinda:~$
Level 2 to 3

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.
Commands you may need to solve this level: ls, cd, cat, file, du, find

bandit2@melinda:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename

Level 3 to 4

The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.

The '-a' option to the 'ls' command shows hidden files. Files are hidden when the name is preceded by a period.

bandit3@melinda:~$ ls -al inhere
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Nov 14 2014 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 14 2014 ..
-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3 33 Nov 14 2014 .hidden
bandit3@melinda:~$ cat inhere/.hidden

Level 4 to 5

The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

bandit4@melinda:~/inhere$ file ./* | grep text
./-file07: ASCII text
bandit4@melinda:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07

Level 5 to 6

The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has all of the following properties: - human-readable - 1033 bytes in size - not executable.

bandit5@melinda:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@melinda:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable | xargs file | grep text | cut -d ":" -f 1 | xargs -I % sh -c "echo % ; cat %"
./maybehere07/.file2
